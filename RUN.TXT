RUN for OS/2 Presentation Manager

From an OS/2 Command prompt, type      START RUN

Creates a moving window that runs from the mouse.  If you can catch it,
click on the system box and close it.  Otherwise, use Ctrl+Esc, select
the program on the Task Manager, and then use Alt-SPC to open its
system menu.  If you start it with the /h option (IN LOWERCASE!), it's
harder to stop because it won't appear on the Task Manager.  The only
way to get rid of it is to catch it.
